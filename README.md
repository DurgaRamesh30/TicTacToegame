🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game (Java Console Project)
📘 Overview

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Java, playable between two players (X and O) on the same console.

🕹️ How to Play

Run the program in your terminal or Java IDE.

The board starts empty and players alternate turns.

When prompted, enter the row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2) where you want to place your mark.
Example:

Player: X enter: 1 2


This places X in row 1, column 2.

If the move is invalid (cell already filled), you'll be asked to try again.

The game ends when:

A player gets 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), or

The board is full (draw situation).
